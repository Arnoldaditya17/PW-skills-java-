(Answer1) 
 Conditional operators are  logical operations to make decisions based on some conditions.
The conditional operators in java are

(1)Equality operators(==) -It is used to compare whether the values are the same or not.

(2)Unequality operators (!=)-It is used to check both the values are unequal.

(3)Greater than operator(>) -It is used to check that the value at the left is greater than the right or 
not.

(4)Less than operator(<)-It is used to check that the left is smaller than the right or not.

(5)Greater than equal to operator(>=)-It  is used to check whether the value at left  is greater or equal to the value at the right .

(6)Less than equal to operator(<=)-It is used to check whether the value at the left is smaller and equal to right or not. 






(Answer2)
On the basic of operand the operator are classified into 3 parts:-
(1)Unary operators.
(2)Binary operators.
(3)ternary operators.








(Answer3)
The use of switch cases is to run the sequence of cases based on the user's choice like from this we can run a particular piece of code when we want.






(Answer4)The parentheses have the highest priority; they execute first after that  unary operators like unary minus(-) and unary(+) then multiplication division and modulus and after that addition and subtraction both of them have the same precedence.





(Answer5)Conditional statements are the control statement which control the flow of execution based on the certain condition 
These are the conditional statement in java:-
IF
IF-ELSE
NESTED IF-ELSE
SWITCH 




(Answer6)The Syntax of IF and ELSE statement is ➖
if(condition)
{


//code;
}

Else
{
//code;

}




(Answer7)
The three type of iterative statement are ➖
While
Do-while
for






(Answer8)
The difference between for and the do-while is first of all in the do-while whether the condition is false or true it will execute the code once .

In the for loop no.of iterations are known.

It will not run the code once before checking the condition.





(Answer9)The code for printing 1-10 is ➖


public class Number{

public static void main(String []arg)
{

 for (int i=1;i<=10;i++)
{
System.out.println(i);
}


}

}
