(1).To create an object first you need a blueprint for which you will create an object that blueprint is called class then you have to use a new keyword to allocate the memory of the object in the memory.

            Syntax:- class name obj= new class name();


(2).The new keyword is used to instantiate the class and allocate the memory  for an object


(3).There are three types of variable in java:-
                Local variable,instance variables and static variable
                
                
(4).An instance variable is a variable which is created outside the method but inside the class.where as the local variable is created inside the method.

An instance variable is created in the heap memory as it is the part of an object.
Whereas a local variable is created inside the stack memory.

An instance variable has some default values like int have 0 and string have null with it whereas local variables have no default values.


(5)Instance variable is created in heap
Local is created in stack


(6).Method overloading is a concept in which we can create many methods with the same name in the same method by changing the number of parameters and data types of the parameters.
