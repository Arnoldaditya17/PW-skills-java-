(1)For different data types the default values of array is âž–
For integers it is 0.
For float it is 0.0.
For String it is null.
For booleans it is false.
For object arrays it is null. 


   (2)Size of an array represents  no. of elements entered in an array but it is not possible to enter the negative no . as a size in an array.

(3) Arrays in java are objects so they are stored in heap memory.


(4) (a) The disadvantages of arrays are once you create an array you can decrease or increase its size.
(b) all the elements in the arrays are homogeneous.



(5) an anonymous array is an array which is created without explicitly assigning  to  the variable it is instantiated without
Providing the name of the array.

(6) In java there are many ways to traverse an array. In java some of them are traditional for loop.
Enhance for loop,while loop and do-while loop.

(7)length is a property of arrays whereas length() is a method of string.

Example:-
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int size = arr.length; // Returns the length of the array, which is 5.


String str = "Hello, World!";
int size = str.length(); // Returns the length of the string, which is 13.
